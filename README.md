# Turing Machine
Very simple and ugly implementation of Turing Machine. It compiles given source code into internal representation, which allows to execute program on pseudo-endless tape. Consist of two components:
- Class `Program` - represents turing machine, responsible for compilation and exectuion.
- Class `EndlessTape` - represents pseudo-endless tape, on which program exectuion is made.

Project made for college exam, resides here for historical purposes.
